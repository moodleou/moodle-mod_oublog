This script describes steps to test the participation facility from a user
perspective. It is intended to cover most of the UI and features.

NOTE: In this test case, the word 'blog' always refers to the OU blog.

The test steps in this script follow on from each other and aren't independent.
They may also be used in conjunction with testcase.usagestats, which should be ran second.


Initial setup
=============

This test case requires:

- a course which has at least two groups defined (G1 and G2).
- two test student users (U S1, who is in group G1, and U S2, in group G2).
- one test teacher (U T1) who is in group G1.
- (admin must have permissions to create/configure activities)
- All users should have an avatar (user picture) set for their profile

The test server must have debugging set to DEVELOPER level and to display
errors; during all parts of the test script, there should be no debugging
warnings.

The completion system must be enabled for (a) the site, and (b) the test
course.

Show blog usage extra statistics must also be enabled
