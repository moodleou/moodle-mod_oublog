This script describes steps to test the OU Blog facility that displays blog usage statistics
from a user perspective. It is intended to cover most of the UI and features.

Note that this feature is intended to display statistics based on blog usage and content,
and as it is only practical to create a small data set in these tests it is recommended
to further test the functionality on a system with real data independently.

NOTE: In this test case, the word 'blog' always refers to the OU blog.

The test steps in this script follow on from each other and aren't independent.


Initial setup
=============

This test case requires:

- Two user accounts (admin & student - admin must have permissions to create/configure activities)
- Both users should have an avatar (user picture) set for their profile
- A test course in which activities can be added, both test users should be enrolled on this course
- Two groups [G1 and G2], both test users should be members of G1. admin should be member of G2 also
- Personal blogs setup on the test system
- Numerous blog activities with various configurations for testing (see CRE)
- Numerous blog, posts and comments for testing (see CRE)

The test server must have debugging set to DEVELOPER level and to display
errors; during all parts of the test script, there should be no debugging
warnings.
